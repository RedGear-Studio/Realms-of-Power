# Settlement 7274

The starting point of the game, "Settlement 7274" is a high-density moon with a harsh environment and settings, but capable of supporting life to a certain extent. Its core is composed of gold, iron, uranium, and platinum, providing abundant resources for mining. The uranium content makes the moon highly radioactive in certain areas, while the iron creates a small electromagnetic field that provides some protection against solar radiation.

Despite the challenges posed by the environment, Settlement 7274 was chosen by the empire as a mining settlement due to the abundance of resources on nearby asteroid rings. However, the settlement is vulnerable to natural events such as solar eruptions, volcanic eruptions from its active core, asteroid falls, extreme radioactivity, drought, and extreme weather conditions.
> Note: 7274 is an easter eggs based on the name of a titan from TitanFall 2.
